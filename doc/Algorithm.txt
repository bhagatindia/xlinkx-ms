Graph based algorithms

Peptide sequence matching

Algorithm 1
-----------
1. A graph based index will be created as per the cut and the sequence being used
2. Each node corresponds to the sequence seen till now
TBD FIXME

Algorithm 2
-----------

Graph construction
1. A graph based index will be created as per the cut and the sequence being used
2. Each node in the graph represents an amino acid
3. Two nodes are connected:
	a. If there is a protein with these two amino acids being adjacent
	b. The weight of this edge is equal to the mass of the amino acid
4. Mark all the cut amino acids as terminal nodes
5. Create an exhaustive list of nodes by going through all the proteins in a sequence
6. The resulting graph will be a Directed Acyclic Graph

Search for an ms/ms with the given precursor mass and the peaks
1. Start from the root node
2. Based on the peaks present in ms/ms, considering the tolerance, traverse the edges
3. Record the paths from root to all the terminal nodes
4. These are the candidate sequences with the tolerance

We can extend and optimize it further using a modified version of KMP algorithm
